## About Scrimba

This app uses OpenAI's Assistant API. 
This is a context aware chat bot that recommends movies based on information from a custom movie database.
For example, I can tell that I need a good laugh and it replies I should definitely watch the movie Glass Onion.
The database in this instance is just a text file with a list of my movie collection that cotains the movie titles and synopsys of each movie. 
The front end has a text field that allows the user to ask questions and the app provides answers based on that list. 
The cool thing about the assistant's API is it reoves the need to manage conversation history. It manages them for you in threads.
